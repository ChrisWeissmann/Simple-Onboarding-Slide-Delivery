      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        This privacy policy refers to the website www.letterbox-app.org. Data protection
        refers to the protection of personal data. This concerns data that can
        be clearly assigned to an individual. When we collect and utilize
        personal data, we confine ourselves strictly to what is technically
        necessary and permitted by law. We collect and use personal data only‚
        with your prior consent or where allowed by law. It is important to us
        that you understand why we collect data and what we use them for. More
        information can be found below.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect information from you when you access the above-named domains.
        This is done only for the purpose of the study and will be used for no
        other reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect on May 25,
        2018. It strengthens the rights of the individual user. Under the point
        "Rights of Individuals" we describe your rights with regard to privacy
        and personal data.
      </p>

      <h3>What is personal information</h3>
      Personal information is information that can be used to identify you. This
      includes information such as your name, postal or IP address (if not
      anonymized), telephone number, and e-mail address, but not information
      that is not associated with your identity (such as anonymous log files in
      which the used browser types are logged). Data provided by you (e.g., data
      input via a web form) can be or contain personal data. We store your data
      only at your request and to the extent needed or for data backup. The specific use of such
      data is indicated in the respective context.


      <h3>Viewing this website</h3>
      When you view the web pages of the above-named website or one of its
      subdomains, a log file is automatically created and stored on the server.
      Such files contain what sites you visited, date, time, the operating
      system you are using, features of the display (resolution in pixels and
      the so-called pixel-ration for the detection of high-resolution
      displays), and the browser you are using (Internet Explorer, Firefox,
      Opera etc.) Further we want to analyze your behavior when on the site and
      therefore time how long you look at each slide of the prototype.
      After answering the survey, the answers given there can be linked to the data collected when visiting the site that is saved in the log file.

      <h3>Rights of Individuals</h3> 
      If you provide us with personal information (e.g., via web forms), you
      will as a rule find contact details on the same page where you can at no
      charge request information regarding which of your personal data are
      stored on our system. At your request, the information can also be
      provided electronically. You have the right to ask the person responsible
      for confirmation of whether your personal data have been processed. If
      this is the case, you have a right of access to such personal data and to
      the information specified in Article 15 of the General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR). You have the right to demand from the person
      responsible the immediate correction of incorrect and personal data
      concerning you and, if necessary, the completion of incomplete personal
      data (Article 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation). You have the
      right to request the person responsible to delete your personal data
      without delay, provided one of the reasons detailed in Article 17 of the
      General Data Protection Regulation applies (right to erasure). The person
      responsible will then no longer process the personal data unless he/she
      can prove compelling legitimate grounds for processing that outweigh the
      interests, rights, and freedoms of the individual concerned. You have the
      right, at any time, to object to the processing of your personal data for
      reasons arising from your particular situation. In such cases, personal
      data may only be processed if there are compelling legitimate reasons for
      the processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms, or if
      the processing serves the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims
      (Article 21 of the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR). You have the
      right to revoke your data protection consent at any time. The revocation
      of consent does not affect the legality of the processing carried out on
      the basis of the consent until the revocation.
